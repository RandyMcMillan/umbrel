# ‚òÇÔ∏è Umbrel ‚Äî A beautiful personal server OS for self-hosting
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Umbrel is currently in beta and is not considered secure. Please see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for more details.

Run a personal server in your home, self-host open source apps like Nextcloud and Bitcoin node, break away from big tech, and take full control of your data. For free.

## üöÄ Getting started

The easiest way to get started is running [Umbrel OS](https://download.umbrel.com/umbrel-os.zip) on a Raspberry Pi. We reccomend a Pi with atleast 8GB RAM. [[Learn More]](https://umbrel.com/#start)

Alternatively you can install Umbrel on an Ubuntu or Debian based system with:

```bash
curl -L https://umbrel.sh | bash
```
